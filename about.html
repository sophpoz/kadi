			<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Kadi, owner and principal photographer of Kadi Tobin Photography and I am so lucky to get to work with such awe-inspiring people every day.</p> 
<p>I love to collaborate with couples who are madly in love, the ones that cant keep their hands off each other, the ones that will run away to to the ocean with their clothes still on, the ones that make out in the rain, and the ones with wild hearts and fire in their soul. I want to be a part of your love story.  At the end of our photography session, I hope that your hair is messy, your shoes are dirty, you are free of any worries and that you had the best time ever.</p>
<p>I have always been asked how long I've been a photographer for.  The truth is, I honestly cant remember a time when I wasn't a photographer.  Photography is in my blood, its a part of me and if I don't have my camera on me it feels as though I'm missing a body part.  The beauty of being an artist is that we are always able to express ourselves.  I have a degree in Fine Arts & Photography from the University of Arizona.  I have explored many different types of photography, but I love working with couples the most, because I'm a fool for love.</p>
<p>When I am not behind my camera you can find me planning my next adventure.  I am on an endless search for the worlds best mac & cheese and barbecue food.  I love all animals (but especially my dog Abbey), wildflowers, waterfalls, epic views, craft beer, Thai food, dance parties and good music.</p>
<p>I am based out of Southern California, but I love to travel absolutely anywhere.  I will follow wherever your wild hearts take me. Let's do this!  California, Arizona, Iceland, Wherever!  </p>
